## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm start

run on http://localhost:8080/
```

## Page Introduction - 3 Pages
- **Homepage** - intial page 
- **Homepage/Order Page** - It is place where the user can order for meal. one from the main course and other meal from different courses(starter, dessert).
- **Homepage/Manage Menu page** - the restaurant can make a changes to the menu(they can change the price or the name of the meal and also they can add new meal if they wanted)

## My task
The rules that I have Implemented:
- Each person must have at least two courses, one of which must be a main.
- Each diner cannot have more than one of the same course.
- There is only one piece of cheesecake left.
- Pierre the snobby waiter will not let you have prawn cocktail and salmon fillet in the same meal.
